### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for playing, and one for viewing the user scores.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, updates board, display other users scores, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - updating board
    - retrieving user scores
- **DB/Login** - Store users, scores, and active games in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't play unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user makes column selection, the board is updated and broadcast to the other user.
